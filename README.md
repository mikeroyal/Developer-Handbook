## Tools

[AppArmor](https://www.apparmor.net/) is an effective and easy-to-use Linux application security system. AppArmor proactively protects the operating system and applications from external or internal threats, even zero-day attacks, by enforcing good behavior and preventing both known and unknown application flaws from being exploited. AppArmor supplements the traditional Unix discretionary access control (DAC) model by providing mandatory access control (MAC). It has been included in the mainline Linux kernel since version 2.6.36 and its development has been supported by Canonical since 2009.

[SELinux](https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux) is a security enhancement to Linux which allows users and administrators more control over access control. Access can be constrained on such variables as which users and applications can access which resources. These resources may take the form of files. Standard Linux access controls, such as file modes (-rwxr-xr-x) are modifiable by the user and the applications which the user runs. Conversely, SELinux access controls are determined by a policy loaded on the system which may not be changed by careless users or misbehaving applications.

  ## Tools & Networking Concepts
  
    • Connection: In networking, a connection refers to pieces of related information that are transferred through a network. This generally infers that a connection is built before the data transfer (by following the procedures laid out in a protocol) and then is deconstructed at the at the end of the data transfer.
    
    • Packet: A packet is, generally speaking, the most basic unit that is transferred over a network. When communicating over a network, packets are the envelopes that carry your data (in pieces) from one end point to the other.
    
Packets have a header portion that contains information about the packet including the source and destination, timestamps, network hops. The main portion of a packet contains the actual data being transferred. It is sometimes called the body or the payload.

    • Network Interface: A network interface can refer to any kind of software interface to networking hardware. For instance, if you have two network cards in your computer, you can control and configure each network interface associated with them individually.
    
A network interface may be associated with a physical device, or it may be a representation of a virtual interface. The "loop-back" device, which is a virtual interface to the local machine, is an example of this.

    • LAN: LAN stands for "local area network". It refers to a network or a portion of a network that is not publicly accessible to the greater internet. A home or office network is an example of a LAN.
    
    • WAN: WAN stands for "wide area network". It means a network that is much more extensive than a LAN. While WAN is the relevant term to use to describe large, dispersed networks in general, it is usually meant to mean the internet, as a whole.
If an interface is connected to the WAN, it is generally assumed that it is reachable through the internet.

    • Protocol: A protocol is a set of rules and standards that basically define a language that devices can use to communicate. There are a great number of protocols in use extensively in networking, and they are often implemented in different layers. 
    
Some low level protocols are TCP, UDP, IP, and ICMP. Some familiar examples of application layer protocols, built on these lower protocols, are HTTP (for accessing web content), SSH, TLS/SSL, and FTP.

    • Port: A port is an address on a single machine that can be tied to a specific piece of software. It is not a physical interface or location, but it allows your server to be able to communicate using more than one application.
    
    • Firewall: A firewall is a program that decides whether traffic coming into a server or going out should be allowed. A firewall usually works by creating rules for which type of traffic is acceptable on which ports. Generally, firewalls block ports that are not used by a specific application on a server.
    
    • NAT: Network address translation is a way to translate requests that are incoming into a routing server to the relevant devices or servers that it knows about in the LAN. This is usually implemented in physical LANs as a way to route requests through one IP address to the necessary backend servers.
    
    • VPN: Virtual private network is a means of connecting separate LANs through the internet, while maintaining privacy. This is used as a means of connecting remote systems as if they were on a local network, often for security reasons.
    
## Network Layers

	While networking is often discussed in terms of topology in a horizontal way, between hosts, its implementation is layered in a vertical fashion throughout a computer or network. This means is that there are multiple technologies and protocols that are built on top of each other in order for communication to function more easily. Each successive, higher layer abstracts the raw data a little bit more, and makes it simpler to use for applications and users. It also allows you to leverage lower layers in new ways without having to invest the time and energy to develop the protocols and applications that handle those types of traffic.
 
	As data is sent out of one machine, it begins at the top of the stack and filters downwards. At the lowest level, actual transmission to another machine takes place. At this point, the data travels back up through the layers of the other computer. Each layer has the ability to add its own "wrapper" around the data that it receives from the adjacent layer, which will help the layers that come after decide what to do with the data when it is passed off.
 
	One method of talking about the different layers of network communication is the OSI model. OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnect.This model defines seven separate layers. The layers in this model are:

    • Application: The application layer is the layer that the users and user-applications most often interact with. Network communication is discussed in terms of availability of resources, partners to communicate with, and data synchronization.
    
    • Presentation: The presentation layer is responsible for mapping resources and creating context. It is used to translate lower level networking data into data that applications expect to see.
    
    • Session: The session layer is a connection handler. It creates, maintains, and destroys connections between nodes in a persistent way.
    
    • Transport: The transport layer is responsible for handing the layers above it a reliable connection. In this context, reliable refers to the ability to verify that a piece of data was received intact at the other end of the connection. This layer can resend information that has been dropped or corrupted and can acknowledge the receipt of data to remote computers.

    • Network: The network layer is used to route data between different nodes on the network. It uses addresses to be able to tell which computer to send information to. This layer can also break apart larger messages into smaller chunks to be reassembled on the opposite end.
    
    • Data Link: This layer is implemented as a method of establishing and maintaining reliable links between different nodes or devices on a network using existing physical connections.
    
    • Physical: The physical layer is responsible for handling the actual physical devices that are used to make a connection. This layer involves the bare software that manages physical connections as well as the hardware itself (like Ethernet).
    
The TCP/IP model, more commonly known as the Internet protocol suite, is another layering model that is simpler and has been widely adopted.It defines the four separate layers, some of which overlap with the OSI model:

    • Application: In this model, the application layer is responsible for creating and transmitting user data between applications. The applications can be on remote systems, and should appear to operate as if locally to the end user. 
The communication takes place between peers network.

    • Transport: The transport layer is responsible for communication between processes. This level of networking utilizes ports to address different services. It can build up unreliable or reliable connections depending on the type of protocol used.
    
    • Internet: The internet layer is used to transport data from node to node in a network. This layer is aware of the endpoints of the connections, but does not worry about the actual connection needed to get from one place to another. IP addresses are defined in this layer as a way of reaching remote systems in an addressable manner.
    
    • Link: The link layer implements the actual topology of the local network that allows the internet layer to present an addressable interface. It establishes connections between neighboring nodes to send data.
    
## Interfaces
Interfaces are networking communication points for your computer. Each interface is associated with a physical or virtual networking device. Typically, your server will have one configurable network interface for each Ethernet or wireless internet card you have. In addition, it will define a virtual network interface called the "loopback" or localhost interface. This is used as an interface to connect applications and processes on a single computer to other applications and processes. You can see this referenced as the "lo" interface in many tools.

## Protocols
Networking works by piggybacks on a number of different protocols on top of each other. In this way, one piece of data can be transmitted using multiple protocols encapsulated within one another.

Media access control is a communications protocol that is used to distinguish specific devices. Each device is supposed to get a unique MAC address during the manufacturing process that differentiates it from every other device on the internet. Addressing hardware by the MAC address allows you to reference a device by a unique value even when the software on top may change the name for that specific device during operation. Media access control is one of the only protocols from the link layer that you are likely to interact with on a regular basis.

The IP protocol is one of the fundamental protocols that allow the internet to work. IP addresses are unique on each network and they allow machines to address each other across a network. It is implemented on the internet layer in the IP/TCP model. Networks can be linked together, but traffic must be routed when crossing network boundaries. This protocol assumes an unreliable network and multiple paths to the same destination that it can dynamically change between. There are a number of different implementations of the protocol. The most common implementation today is IPv4, although IPv6 is growing in popularity as an alternative due to the scarcity of IPv4 addresses available and improvements in the protocols capabilities.

ICMP: internet control message protocol is used to send messages between devices to indicate the availability or error conditions. These packets are used in a variety of network diagnostic tools, such as ping and traceroute. Usually ICMP packets are transmitted when a packet of a different kind meets some kind of a problem. Basically, they are used as a feedback mechanism for network communications.

TCP: Transmission control protocol is implemented in the transport layer of the IP/TCP model and is used to establish reliable connections. TCP is one of the protocols that encapsulates data into packets. It then transfers these to the remote end of the connection using the methods available on the lower layers. On the other end, it can check for errors, request certain pieces to be resent, and reassemble the information into one logical piece to send to the application layer. The protocol builds up a connection prior to data transfer using a system called a three-way handshake. This is a way for the two ends of the communication to acknowledge the request and agree upon a method of ensuring data reliability. After the data has been sent, the connection is torn down using a similar four-way handshake. TCP is the protocol of choice for many of the most popular uses for the internet, including WWW, FTP, SSH, and email. It is safe to say that the internet we know today would not be here without TCP.

UDP: User datagram protocol is a popular companion protocol to TCP and is also implemented in the transport layer. The fundamental difference between UDP and TCP is that UDP offers unreliable data transfer. It does not verify that data has been received on the other end of the connection. This might sound like a bad thing, and for many purposes, it is. However, it is also extremely important for some functions. It’s not required to wait for confirmation that the data was received and forced to resend data, UDP is much faster than TCP. It does not establish a connection with the remote host, it simply fires off the data to that host and doesn't care if it is accepted or not. Since UDP is a simple transaction, it is useful for simple communications like querying for network resources. It also doesn't maintain a state, which makes it great for transmitting data from one machine to many real-time clients. This makes it ideal for VOIP, games, and other applications that cannot afford delays.

HTTP: Hypertext transfer protocol is a protocol defined in the application layer that forms the basis for communication on the web. HTTP defines a number of functions that tell the remote system what you are requesting. For instance, GET, POST, and DELETE all interact with the requested data in a different way.

[JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io) is a compact URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is digitally signed using JSON Web Signature (JWS).

[OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) is an open source authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service, such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter GitHub, and DigitalOcean. It works by delegating user authentication to the service that hosts the user account, and authorizing third-party applications to access the user account.

FTP: File transfer protocol is in the application layer and provides a way of transferring complete files from one host to another. It is inherently insecure, so it is not recommended for any externally facing network unless it is implemented as a public, download-only resource.

DNS: Domain name system is an application layer protocol used to provide a human-friendly naming mechanism for internet resources. It is what ties a domain name to an IP address and allows you to access sites by name in your browser.

SSH: Secure shell is an encrypted protocol implemented in the application layer that can be used to communicate with a remote server in a secure way. Many additional technologies are built around this protocol because of its end-to-end encryption and ubiquity. There are many other protocols that we haven't covered that are equally important. However, this should give you a good overview of some of the fundamental technologies that make the internet and networking possible.

## Virtualization

[KVM (for Kernel-based Virtual Machine)](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V). It consists of a loadable kernel module, kvm.ko, that provides the core virtualization infrastructure and a processor specific module, kvm-intel.ko or kvm-amd.ko.

#### A guide covering the Rust programming language including the applications and tools that will make you a better and more efficient Rust developer.

## Resources

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) is a multi-paradigm programming language focused on performance and safety. Rust has a comparable amount of runtime to C and C++, and has set up its standard library to be amenable towards OS development. Specifically, the standard library is split into two parts: core and std. Core is the lowest-level aspects only, and doesn't include things like allocation, threading, and other higher-level features.

## Agile Methodologies & Disciplines

[Scrum](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum) is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.
    
[Lean](https://resources.collab.net/agile-101/agile-methodologies) is an agile methodology that eliminates waste through such practices as selecting only the truly valuable features for a system, prioritizing those selected, and delivering them in small batches. It emphasizes the speed and efficiency of development workflow, and relies on rapid and reliable feedback between programmers and customers. Lean uses the idea of work product being "pulled" via customer request. It focuses decision-making authority and ability on individuals and small teams, since research shows this to be faster and more efficient than hierarchical flow of control. Lean also concentrates on the efficiency of the use of team resources, trying to ensure that everyone is productive as much of the time as possible. It concentrates on concurrent work and the fewest possible intra-team workflow dependencies. Lean also strongly recommends that automated unit tests be written at the same time the code is written. 
    
[Kanban](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban) is a scheduling system for lean manufacturing and just-in-time manufacturing. Like Scrum, Kanban is a process designed to help teams work together more effectively.
    
[Kanban board](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards) is an agile project management tool designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow).

[Crystal](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/crystal-agile-framework/) is an agile framework focusing on individuals and their interactions, as opposed to processes and tools. In other words, this framework is a direct outgrowth of one of the core values articulated in the [Agile Manifesto](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/the-agile-manifesto/).The Crystal agile framework is built on two core beliefs:

    Teams can find ways on their own to improve and optimize their workflows
    
    Every project is unique and always changing, which is why that project’s team is best suited to determine how it will tackle the work

[Adaptive software development (ASD)](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/adaptive-software-development/) is a direct outgrowth of an earlier agile framework, Rapid Application Development (RAD). It aims to enable teams to quickly and effectively adapt to changing requirements or market needs by evolving their products with lightweight planning and continuous learning.
    
[Disciplined agile delivery](https://www.pmi.org/disciplined-agile/process/introduction-to-dad) is a people-first, learning-oriented hybrid agile approach to IT solution delivery. It has a risk-value delivery lifecycle, is goal-driven, is enterprise aware, and is scalable.
    
[Feature-driven development (FDD)](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/feature-driven-development/) is an agile framework that, as its name suggests, organizes software development around making progress on features. Features in the FDD context, though, are not necessarily product features in the commonly understood sense. 
    
[Scrumban](https://www.agilealliance.org/what-is-scrumban/) is an Agile management methodology that combines hybrids of Scrum and Kanban together. It was originally designed as a way to transition from Scrum to Kanban.
    
[Kanplan](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/kanplan) is a mixed methodology for practicing agile software development. Like scrumban, it combines features from both scrum and kanban. Kanplan is ideal for teams who want the ability to backlog groom, but don't want to work in sprints.
    
[RAD(Rapid Application Development)](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/rapid-application-development/)  is an agile framework focused primarily on rapid prototyping of software products, frequently iterating based on feedback, and continuously releasing updated versions of those products to the market.

## Data Structures

[Arrays](https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/arrays/) are a series of elements(numbers, booleans, or strings) of the same type placed in phyiscal memory locations that can be individually referenced by adding an index to a unique identifier.

 - [Vector](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/) is a dynamic array, where the size can be increased when an element is inserted or deleted, with the storage being handled automatically by the container.

[Linked Lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.

 - [Singly Linked List](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/linked-list/singly-linked-list/) is a type of linked data structure where each node points to the next node in the sequence. It does not have any pointer that points to the previous node.
 
 - [Doubly-Linked List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list) is a type of linked data structure in which each node apart from storing its data has two links. A node consists of three parts: node data, a pointer to the next node in sequence (next pointer), pointer to the previous node (previous pointer). 

[Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) is a nonlinear data structure unlike arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures. A tree can be empty with no nodes or in other instances a tree's structure consists of one node called the root and 0 or 1 or more subtrees.

 - Basic Tree
 - Binary Tree
 - Binary Search Tree
 - AVL Tree
 - Red-Black Tree
 - N-ary Tree

[Hash Tables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/deep-dives/everything-about-hashtable?view=powershell-7.1)is a data structure, much like an array, except you store each value (object) using a key. It is a basic key/value store for mapping known as a hash function.

[Stacks](https://www.thedshandbook.com/stacks/) is a linear data structure that store data in an order known as the Last In First Out (LIFO) order. 

- LIFO (Last In First Out)  
- FILO (First In Last Out)

[Queues](https://www.thedshandbook.com/queues/) is a linear data structure that stores data in an order known as the First In First Out(FIFO) order.

[Heaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)) is a specialized tree-based data structure which is essentially an almost complete tree that satisfies the heap property.

- Max Heap
- Min-Heap
- Binary Heap

[Graphs](https://www.thedshandbook.com/graphs/) is a data structure that represent relations between pairs of objects. It consists of nodes (known as vertices) that are connected through links (known as edges). 

## Algorithms

**Graph Algorithms**

- Breadth First Search (BFS)

## Resources

[Differential Privacy](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-lab-differential-privacy) is a system that simultaneously enables researchers and analysts to extract useful insights from datasets containing personal information and offers stronger privacy protections. This is achieved by introducing "statistical noise".

[Statistical Noise](https://news.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/08/27/statistical-noise-data-differential-privacy/) is a process that small aletrations to masked datasets. The statistical noise hides identifiable characteristics of individuals, ensuring that the privacy of personal information is protected, but it's small enough to not materially impact the accuracy of the answers extracted by analysts and researchers.

[Laplacian Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_distribution) is a mechanism that adds Laplacian-distributed noise to a function.

OpenStack includes advance use of virtualization & SDN for network traffic optimization to handle the core cloud-computing services of compute, networking, storage, identity, and image services.

[StarlingX](https://www.starlingx.io/) is a complete cloud infrastructure software stack for the edge used by the most demanding applications in industrial IOT, telecom, video delivery and other ultra-low latency use cases.

[Airship](https://www.airshipit.org/) is a collection of open source tools for automating cloud provisioning and management. Airship provides a declarative framework for defining and managing the life cycle of open infrastructure tools and the underlying hardware.

[Network functions virtualization (NFV)](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/network-functions-virtualization-nfv) is the replacement of network appliance hardware with virtual machines. The virtual machines use a hypervisor to run networking software and processes such as routing and load balancing. NFV allows for the separation of communication services from dedicated hardware, such as routers and firewalls. This separation means network operations can provide new services dynamically and without installing new hardware. Deploying network components with network functions virtualization only takes hours compared to months like with traditional networking solutions. 

[Software Defined Networking (SDN)](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/software-defined-networking) is an approach to networking that uses software-based controllers or application programming interfaces (APIs) to communicate with underlying hardware infrastructure and direct traffic on a network. This model differs from that of traditional networks, which use dedicated hardware devices (routers and switches) to control network traffic. 

[Virtualized Infrastructure Manager (VIM)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/net_mgmt/network_function_virtualization_Infrastructure/3_2_2/install_guide/Cisco_VIM_Install_Guide_3_2_2/Cisco_VIM_Install_Guide_3_2_2_chapter_00.html) is a service delivery and reduce costs with high performance lifecycle management Manage the full lifecycle of the software and hardware comprising your NFV infrastructure (NFVI), and maintaining a live inventory and allocation plan of both physical and virtual resources.

[Management and Orchestration(MANO)](https://www.etsi.org/technologies/open-source-mano) is an ETSI-hosted initiative to develop an Open Source NFV Management and Orchestration (MANO) software stack aligned with ETSI NFV. Two of the key components of the ETSI NFV architectural framework are the NFV Orchestrator and VNF Manager, known as NFV MANO.

[Magma](https://www.magmacore.org/) is an open source software platform that gives network operators an open, flexible and extendable mobile core network solution. Their mission is to connect the world to a faster network by enabling service providers to build cost-effective and extensible carrier-grade networks. Magma is 3GPP generation (2G, 3G, 4G or upcoming 5G networks) and access network agnostic (cellular or WiFi). It can flexibly support a radio access network with minimal development and deployment effort.

[OpenRAN](https://open-ran.org/) is an intelligent Radio Access Network(RAN) integrated on general purpose platforms with open interface between software defined functions. Open RANecosystem enables enormous flexibility and interoperability with a complete openess to multi-vendor deployments.

[Open vSwitch(OVS)](https://www.openvswitch.org/)is an open source production quality, multilayer virtual switch licensed under the open source Apache 2.0 license. It is designed to enable massive network automation through programmatic extension, while still supporting standard management interfaces and protocols (NetFlow, sFlow, IPFIX, RSPAN, CLI, LACP, 802.1ag).

[Edge](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/what-is-edge-computing) is a distributed computing framework that brings enterprise applications closer to data sources such as IoT devices or local edge servers. This proximity to data at its source can deliver strong business benefits, including faster insights, improved response times and better bandwidth availability.

[Multi-access edge computing (MEC)](https://www.etsi.org/technologies/multi-access-edge-computing) is an Industry Specification Group (ISG) within ETSI to create a standardized, open environment which will allow the efficient and seamless integration of applications from vendors, service providers, and third-parties across multi-vendor Multi-access Edge Computing platforms.

[Virtualized network functions(VNFs)](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/cso4.1/topics/concept/nsd-vnf-overview.html) is a software application used in a Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) implementation that has well defined interfaces, and provides one or more component networking functions in a defined way. For example, a security VNF provides Network Address Translation (NAT) and firewall component functions.
 
[Cloud-Native Network Functions(CNF)](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2020/11/18/cloud-native-network-functions-conformance-launched-by-cncf/) is a network function designed and implemented to run inside containers. CNFs inherit all the cloud native architectural and operational principles including Kubernetes(K8s) lifecycle management, agility, resilience, and observability.
 
[Physical Network Function(PNF)](https://www.mpirical.com/glossary/pnf-physical-network-function) is a physical network node which has not undergone virtualization. Both PNFs and VNFs (Virtualized Network Functions) can be used to form an overall Network Service.

[Network functions virtualization infrastructure(NFVI)](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vCloud-NFV/2.0/vmware-vcloud-nfv-reference-architecture-20/GUID-FBEA6C6B-54D8-4A37-87B1-D825F9E0DBC7.html) is the foundation of the overall NFV architecture. It provides the physical compute, storage, and networking hardware that hosts the VNFs. Each NFVI block can be thought of as an NFVI node and many nodes can be deployed and controlled geographically.
